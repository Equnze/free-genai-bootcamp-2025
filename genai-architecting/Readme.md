## Business Goal:
As a Solution Architect after consulting with real-world AI Engineers, you have been tasked to create architectural diagram(s) that serve as a teaching aid to help stakeholders understand their key components of GenAI workloads. The outcome is to help let stakeholders visualize possible technical paths, technical uncertainty when adopting GenAI.

We are guiding key stakeholders through the technical landscape without directly prescribing solutions, while fostering informed discussions about infrastructure choices, integration patterns, and system dependencies across the organization.

We can use all levels of technical diagramming to achieve our goal.
